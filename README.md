# Welcome to the Optibrium technical test!

The purpose of this test is to enable candidates to demonstrate some of their web development capabilities.

The generated solution is intended to be reviewed before, and demonstrated at, interview.

The test should only take about an hour (or maybe thirty minutes if you are fast).

## The task ... "Cats, Dogs and their Owners".

In the same folder as this one you will find an service specification for a CatsDogsOwners(CDO) API.

For this technical test you need to design a single page application that will consume this CDO API, and allow users of the page to:

- Create, list, rename and delete; Cats, Dogs and Owners.

- Allocate pets to, and remove Pets from, an Owner.

There are a few requirements that we would like you to work in to your solution...
It is important that page users are able to perform their pet based administration tasks very quickly.
After surveying a small user group we have determined that the following features are highly desirable to CDO users:

- A single page where all Cats, Dogs and Owners are visible at the same time.

- A 'card' based system, in which each Cat, Dog or Owner is represented by a card that can be dragged and dropped.

- Dragging a Cat or Dog card onto an Owner card should allocate that Pet to that Owner.

- All cards should present an intuitive way to rename or delete the card.

- It is desirable that removing a Pet from an Owner should be as equally fast to perform as adding them.

- It is desirable for the cards to be colour coded.

- It is desirable for the cards to be drag-and-droppable anywhere on the page.

## Administration

Git is an important technology to us. Please push your solution to GitHub and send us a link.

We are interested in your adding your own personal style to the test. Complete it using whatever methodology you want to; however, it is important to note that the code will be reviewed and run by a number of people of varying technical levels, both junior and senior. It is therefore very important that your code is both sufficiently simple that a non-web developer can run it, and at the same time demonstrates your abilities.

Finally at the interview stage we will provide an actual API URL to demonstrate against.
